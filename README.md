## Inspiration
With the onset of COVID-19, I noticed a huge shift in the dance community. Like many other fields, dancers and choreographers put their rehearsals on pause, cancelled performances, and transitioned to online classes. Life was haulted, and artists had more desire than ever to connect and create work. Unfortunately, the dance community is not centralized or unionized, so there was no place for dancers to turn to showcase their work. I decided to create an app that I would not only use myself, but also offer to my friends running large dance institutions and creating project-based work in NYC. A spot where artists could easily share their projects, and (following the same "donation" model many of these showcases use in-person) allow viewers to donate towards access to watch full length dance pieces. I hope to continue building this app out to meet all desired functionality, and hosting it so the community can have a free resource for watching dance.
